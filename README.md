# ✍️ Handwriting LiveOCR  

Real-time handwriting recognition using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV**.  
This project trains a deep learning model on the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits), then uses a webcam to recognize digits live.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST with ~98% accuracy  
- Save and reload the trained model (`mnist_model.h5`)  
- Test predictions on sample MNIST digits  
- Live prediction via webcam using OpenCV  
- Extendable to letters using the EMNIST dataset
